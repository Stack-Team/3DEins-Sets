Just place `3DEins-Sets.unistore` and / or `3DZwei-Sets.unistore` to `sdmc:/3ds/Universal-Updater/stores/` and have fun downloading Sets for 3DEins & 3DZwei.

Alternatively, you can also now use Universal-Updater v3's QR Code function, to download those.. without the need to take out the SD Card.. or do it over FTP!
